Congrats for the installation!

Now, you have to initalise withings-sync by doing:

```
 __INSTALL_DIR__/venv/bin/withings-sync
```

An URL will be proposed. You’ll have to copy-paste it in a browser and login in your Withings account.
A token will be shown. You’ll have to copy it and pasted in back in the terminal.

That’s it! 

Now, withings-sync will sync every hour o’clock.
